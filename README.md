# Reinforcement-Learning-algorithm-for-Adapting-to-Learner-s-Cognitive-Differences
This Capstone project at Nazarbayev University implements an RL algorithm utilizing a Deep Q-network To optimize engagement and learning, the robots can use RL to track a child's learning patterns and use that information to modify the level of task difficulty. The adaptation might also benefit RL by observing the child's engagement in real time and adapting its social behaviors.
